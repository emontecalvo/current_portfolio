				<p><strong>challenge: </strong> The Daily UI Challenge is a series of 100 UI projects.<a id="a-daily" href="http://www.dailyui.co/" target="_blank">(http://www.dailyui.co/)</a>  #dailyui </p>
				<p><strong>process: </strong> Originally I started the Daily UI Challenge using only Sketch and limited myself to a 15-minute timebox. About 3/4 of the way through creating 15-minute designs in Sketch, I wanted to make these interactive. Looking for a way to practice my React, JavaScript, C# and Unity skills, this seemed like a good challenge and with 100 UI's, the project will be a substantial UI library.  The original Unity container system for a mobile-device had to be redone after deciding to launch the demo site via WebGL.  The React demo utilizes GitHub pages and involved a substitute "Home" component. </p>
				<p><strong>results: </strong> The Unity portion is about 30% complete, and the React portion is about 10% complete.  The WebGL demo site has some clunkiness.  So far, it has been easier to obtain a professional UI with the React.</p>

						<p class="project-text-title">initial designs & iterations:</p>
						<ul>
							<li>Initial designs done daily in Sketch with only a 15-minute timebox.</li>
							<li>The designs I personally loved most were generally the earlier projects.</li>
							<li>Designs were done "fresh", I only looked at other designers work after my creation in order to compare, which is opposite of how I generally work as I prefer to consult the work of experts and gather ideas.</li>

						<p class="project-text-title">unity:</p>
						<ul>
							<li>While Unity has quite the built-in GUI system (UGUI), in order to improve my C# skills and deepen my knowledge of the Unity framework as a whole, the Daily UI's were created with C# code for most of the interaction instead of relying on UGUI for the heavy lifting.</li>
							<li>Prior to launching the demo site with WebGL, the container system developed worked perfectly and transitions were fairly smooth.  After deciding to launch the demo with WebGL, the container configurations needed to be re-done and still need improvement as the interactions aren't as smooth and the visuals aren't as sharp.</li>
							<li>Despite Unity's asset-management issues for production-level apps (scale; versioning doesn't translate well to dynamic updating verses bundles; memory management has poor control over visibility over what is available in memeory at any given time), it has been a joy and a pleasure to work in Unity again after a time away.</li>
							<li>Favorite Daily UI was an animated timer, showing a cloud emptying it's rain out as the timer counted down.</li>

						<p class="project-text-title">react / redux / css:</p>
						<ul>
							<li>Components were subdivided by days of tens, and then single days within those components.</li>
							<li>Currently there is only one action and reducer file, but that will need to be expanded as the Daily UI's grow.</li>
							<li>Demo site was launched by using Github pages for hosting and creating a substitute "Home" component to highlight my favorite of the UI's.</li>
							<li>Professional-looking UI's utilizing React and CSS were easier to achieve than with Unity.</li>
							<li>I enjoyed exploring color gradient transitions with CSS.</li>
							<li>Be it the 80's nostalgia or CSS color gradient transitions, my favorite Daily UI in react was the User Profile, featuring the Princess from the movie <em>The NeverEnding Story</em></li>
