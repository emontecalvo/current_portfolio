			<div class="project-summary">
				<p><strong>challenge: </strong>learn a completely new-to-me framework (Phaser) within a time-frame of five days, and launch it live on the Android store.</p>
				<p><strong>process: </strong>I dove into tutorials on Phaser, while sketching out a game idea.  I would follow along with a tutorial, next dive into trying my hand at something original, then back to another tutorial, then back to my project.  I conducted rapid user-research within a circle of gamers to check on the fun-factor of the game idea and usability with the website prototype.  Game art was created using Sketch and GIMP.  I coded this using JavaScript and, after writing my own physics, discarded that in favor of the built-in Phaser physics.  Launching the game required a series of exhilerating hoop-jumping, utilizing Cordova and IntelXDK.  Splash pages, thumbnails and icons needed to be created within a moment's notice to launch on time. </p>
						<p><strong>results: </strong>Mondo Is Phat is live on the Android store, a five-day learn-it-to-make-it-to-launch-it game.</p>

							<li>Start the process of setting up a Phaser project and getting familiar with moving around in the engine.</li>

						<p class="project-text-title">user persona:</p>
						<ul>
							<li>Given such limited time, the scope of the game would need to be short and sweet.</li>
							<li>Mobile games are typically used in short intervals (as opposed to desktop or console games where the user is usually more committed to playing for a longer chunk of time.</li>
							<li>The game is designed to be relaxing and requires minimal effort; a simple piece of entertainment.</li>
							<li>Typical user would be somebody who needs a laugh while standing in line at the grocery store or after a hard day at work.  The user doesn't need to think about the game after they put it down or when they start playing.  The lead character moves easilly with minimal effort.</li>

							<li>Game Backstory:  Mondo is a Phat and Phabulous cat. He owns it like a BOSS! He eats what he eats, he hates what he hates and does what he wants.  All he wanted was to eat and sleep, but the haters wouldn't leave him alone.  Sometimes, there is a peace that can only be found after war.  And today, Mondo got out of the house.</li>
							<li>Game Objective: This is a relaxing game. Mondo eats the mice, chihuahuas, and food. He likes only tuna, strawberry jam, hot cocoa and scrambled egggs.  Belly-bop the enemies (mice and chihuahuas).  Jump to get the food.  Watch your vengeance points accumulate.</li>
							<li>Just a few screens/scenes will be needed.</li>
							<li>Forward/backward buttons only need to be touched once for mobile, but it was discovered they were more fun to click multiple times on the web-version, so game was adjusted for that after user testing.</li>
							<li>Short backstory is shown on the intro screen.</li>
							<li>Short instructions / objective.</li>
							<li>Outline of scene and character movement.</li>

						<p class="project-text-title">learning process & other adventures in hoop-jumping:</p>
						<ul>
							<li>First time dive into Phaser also led into a first-time dive into IntelXDK and Cordova, with only one day before the deadline!</li>
							<li>Setting up the SDK file required very specific icons, splash pages and thumbnails in various dimensions, which had to be created on the spot.</li>
							<li>Setting up an Android developer account was relatively simple.</li>
							<li>I was impressed with Android's violence survey, and how accurately it was able rate the "violence" of this game (cartoonish, the character just swallows his enemies and Android rated this as "mild fantasy violence"). </li>
							<li>Once SDK file was built, and the correct art for the Android store is available, it was live on the store very quickly, under two hours in this case.  Not bad for a first time launch.</li>
