				<p><strong>problem to solve: </strong>  We have built the technology that can take a picture of produce (fruit, vegetables) from a phone and analyze how fresh it is, and even see if it is organic or not - but can a regular person understand, use and want to use the data?  Can we get results specific enough to make a difference to help stores?</p>
				<p><strong>process: </strong> Deciding on the scope of the app was an ongoing process due to the interest garnered by different companies at random intervals.  Originally the idea was that Poma would be a consumer app, but after industry interest from companies dealing in produce, a B2B app was pushed through. First engineered with Android studio, the second iteration involved a rebuild in Unity.  As talks with stakeholders emerged, a corresponding website would also be needed.  Several trips to offices, farms and warehouses were made, both to gather information about users as well as the business needs and state of the produce at each phase.  A wide range of users with different jobs in varied conditions would need to be able to use the app, with management and corporate employees accessing the website to generate data and reports.</p>
				<p><strong>summary: </strong> The Poma technology has the ability to take a picture of a fruit or vegetable and analyze how ripe and fresh the product is.  Pictures are even able to tell the difference between organic and conventionally grown fruit.  The science is fascinating, and Poma has the potential to create a new market in the produce business.  My UX involvement has been on an as-needed basis (ranging from every other month to every day).</p>

						<ul>
							<li>	The white color in Poma’s letter “m” is actually intended to be clear as a sticker, and that would be where we would get to see the vegetable/fruit.  Take a picture of the produce with your phone and Poma analyzes how fresh / ripe it is, comparing the color of the produce through the sticker to the information in our database.</li>

							<li>Four main categories of users were identified through research: corporate employees, middle-management, warehouse employees and produce clerks.</li>
							<li>Conditions would vary from user to user, the app being used in the produce isle, at a warehouse, on a farm, an office and boardroom.</li>

							<li>Wireframes were requested for stakeholder meetings, semi-high fidelity</li>
							<li>Wonderful learning process for me as the UX designer, because although the wireframes I created were not in the style I wished them to be (by request of the founder), they were ultimately audience-appropriate for the other stakeholders.</li>
							<li>The website would need client views, as well as views that were Poma-dev team only.</li>
							<li>The information architecture at this point in time had not solidified and we were presenting an overview for feedback.</li>
