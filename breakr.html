				<p class="project-sum-title"><em>Full-stack app for tracking breaks.  Distributed team.  Built using: React, Redux, Node.js, Express and MongoDB (MERN stack).</em></p>
				<p><strong>process: </strong> Every person on the team brought their own idea for a full-stack app.  The "timer app" idea had the strongest buy-in, both because it was the most useful app idea presented and the most feasible given the time constraints.  Originally we thought we would approach building this with a "divide-and-conquor" approach, but found it more educational to do pair-programming.</p>
				<p><strong>results: </strong> The app features a login option in order for the user to track their breaks for better productivity.  The user can also enter as a guest if they don't wish to track.  The timer animation changes colors as the amount of time left decreases.</p>

					<p class="project-text-title">motivation:</p>
					<ul>
						<li>Studies show that taking a break once an hour increases our work productivity. After a while, our brain becomes numb to constant stimulation and it becomes harder to focus. A break can serve as creative fuel so that we are able to come back to the task at hand renewed and reenergized. Breakr can assure that happens.</li>
						<li>Breakr allows users to set an interval for their work time, after which a popup notification and sound will alert the user that it is time to take a break. Set a new timer for your break period and be alerted when it is time to get back to work.</li>
					</ul>

					<ul>
						<li>This app was built to be responsive across multiple web-browsers and multiple sizes.</li>
						<li>The front-end was built entirely with React and Redux. CSS animations were used to achieve the visual timer countdown.</li>
						<li>Passport and bcrypt were used for authentication. The app allows for people to create a user-login, or use the app as a guest if prefered.</li>
						<li>The database was built using MongoDB and Express.</li>
						<li>The JavaScript code dealing with calculating the appropriate time can be found in the Timer.js component.</li>
						<li>Testing was achieved by using Chai.</li>
